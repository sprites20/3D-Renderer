3D render WIP. The rotations is 180 degrees flipped and I just need a correctional matrix

Install requirements:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Then:
```
python somepygame.py
```

You need at least OpenGL 2.x.x to run this and mostly requires updating your graphics driver. I mean what kind of PC you using without a GPU bruh, live a little.
